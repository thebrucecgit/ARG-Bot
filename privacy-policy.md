# ARG-Bot Privacy Policy

The bot does not store any data to disk, and does not use any database. Each command input is processed by the bot and an output is provided to the user - neither of which is persisted in anyway. 

The only information kept across commands executions is the counter of "Commands executed" seen in `/stats`. This counter is only stored in memory and is reset after a restart.
